		<h1>How are you doing?</h1>
		<p> Hopefully you are doing really well. It's important to drink lots of coffee and stuff. Coffee is good for you, but can
			also cause some stomach problems and such.
			MP3s can totally change the industry in a really interesting way. These are lower quality audio because of the bandwidth constraints.
			Dont hurt your business if people arent going to the studios. Take a break from the business and maybe go back to school. Following
			your dreams can be a path to unfullfillment. Giving up isn't giving up, it's changing because you change. Make sure youre not leaving
			any money on the table. It's a big table and it likes to eat up the money, but don't let that take things over, you know? Just keep your 
			stuff together and everything will be ok. The Jedi council beliveves in you. Passion trumps money and skills which is a shame but it's what
			makes us human. To fail is to be human. To human is to fail. To flail is to not swim. </p>
