  <h1>Budget</h1>
  <p>
  Going responsive is typically cheaper to deploy and develop than fully native
  applications. Native apps require specialized platform skills
  and are more expensive than responsive web sites. If the budget is small,
  beginning with a mobile responive site and adding a native option later is
  a sound strategy.</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Is the budget limited?</h4>
      <div class='buttons'>
			  <button>NO</button>
			  <button>YES</button>
      </div>
		</p>
</script>

<script type='text/template' id='q3Content'>
  <h1>Content Monitization</h1>
  <p>Monitizing digital content and encouraging micro-transactions are best
  handled via a native platform. Native in-app purchases are easier to integrate
  and cheaper to maintain than a full-scale web E-commerce system.</p>
		<p>
    <h4>Monitizing digital content?</h4>
      <div class='buttons'>
			  <button>NO</button>
			  <button>YES</button>
      </div>
		</p>
</script>


<script type='text/template' id='q4Content'>
  <h1>Rich Data Creation</h1>
  <p>Users love apps that allow them to express their creativity through
  original works of art; take pictures record video, and compose music! Native devices
  include special processing power to capture and manipulate digital media.
  If your app requires these features, the best user experience for rich data creation is native.</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Does your app require rich data creation?</h4>
      <div class='buttons'>
			  <button>NO</button>
			  <button>YES</button>
      </div>
		</p>
</script>

<script type='text/template' id='q5Content'>
  <h1>Updates</h1>
  <p>Frequent content updates (new apartment listings?) or other data may be
  necessary to keep the application meaningful.Updating web based applications is very easy, and
  also makes updates instantly available to all users. Native apps may
  require approval from specific app stores which drags out the update process.
  Once the update is made available, users must also manually update the app.</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Frequent Updates?</h4>
      <div class='buttons'>
			  <button>NO</button>
			  <button>YES</button>
      </div>
		</p>
</script>

<script type='text/template' id='q6Content'>
  <h1>App Purpose</h1>
		<p>If the app itself is the digital good which your company produces as a
    primary product, native offers the best user experience and tightest
    platform integration. If the application is not the primary product and is
    instead used as a conduit for business ie - used car sales, airline app,
    etc than responsive web may be a better business choice.</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Application primary product?</h4>
      <div class='buttons'>
			  <button>NO</button>
			  <button>YES</button>
      </div>
		</p>
</script>

<script type='text/template' id='q7Content'>
  <h1>Push Notifications?</h1>
		<p>Push notifications are not available from responsive web pages. The user
    must have the website open on their device to receive new data. Pushing data down
    to the user while the phone is in pocket or purse is a feature only available to
    native apps.</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Business depend on push notifications?</h4>
      <div class='buttons'>
			  <button>NO</button>
			  <button>YES</button>
      </div>
		</p>
</script>

<script type='text/template' id='q8Content'>
  <h1>Accessibility</h1>
		<p>If your app has strict accessibility requirements, responsive web allows
    content to be accesible on any device with a web browser. That means
    basically every computer,tablet and smartphone now, and for the forseeable
    future.</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Universal accessibility important?</h4>
      <div class='buttons'>
			  <button>NO</button>
			  <button>YES</button>
      </div>
		</p>
</script>

<script type='text/template' id='q9Content'>
  <h1>User Interface</h1>
		<p>A dynamic user interface with many fast moving animations or
    visualizations is possible with current web technologies, but performance
    and consistency across all devices can be a challenge. Native platforms are
    better suited because of specialized graphics processing power and ensure consistent,
    fast animation.</p>
		<p>
			<h4>Complex user interface?</h4>
      <div class='buttons'>
			  <button>NO</button>
			  <button>YES</button>
      </div>
		</p>
</script>

<script type='text/template' id='q10Content'>
  <h1>What to do?</h1>
		<p>Good luck! We hope your dev efforts work out!</p>

			<h4>Thanks for using the tool!</h4>

		<h1>Responsive Web or Native?</h1>
		<p> Hopefully you are doing really well. It's important to drink lots of coffee and stuff. Coffee is good for you, but can
			also cause some stomach problems and such.
			MP3s can totally change the industry in a really interesting way. These are lower quality audio because of the bandwidth constraints.
			Dont hurt your business if people arent going to the studios. Take a break from the business and maybe go back to school. Following
			your dreams can be a path to unfullfillment. Giving up isn't giving up, it's changing because you change. Make sure youre not leaving
			any money on the table. It's a big table and it likes to eat up the money, but don't let that take things over, you know? Just keep your 
			stuff together and everything will be ok. The Jedi council beliveves in you. Passion trumps money and skills which is a shame but it's what
			makes us human. To fail is to be human. To human is to fail. To flail is to not swim. </p>
