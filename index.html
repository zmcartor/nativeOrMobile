  <h1>Budget</h1>
  <p>
  If you budget is very tight, mobile responsive sites are typically more
expensive than full native applications. Going responsive
will allow your limited budget to hit as many screen sizes as possible.</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Is the budget tight?</h3>
			  <button>NO</button>
			  <button>YES</button>
		</p>
</script>

<script type='text/template' id='q2Content'>
  <h1>Content Monitization</h1>
		<p>Does your company make money by selling content ie - audio/video/text ?
Native in-app purchases are easier than a full-blown e-commerce website. Native
devices are specifically designed for the consumption of these types of media.
Will the app make money by monitization of content ?
</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Making money by charging for content?</h3>
			  <button>NO</button>
			  <button>YES</button>

		<p>
			<h3> Doing stuff with data?</h3>
			  <button>NO</button>
			  <button>YES</button>
		</p>
</script>

<script type='text/template' id='q4Content'>
  <h1>Frequent Updates</h1>
  <p>Frequent updates can be a pain in the ass for native and could 
  require approval on some platforms. Are you sure you need this headache?</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Frequent updates yo?</h3>
			  <button>NO</button>
			  <button>YES</button>
		</p>
</script>

<script type='text/template' id='q5Content'>
  <h1>App Purpose</h1>
		<p>Does the app provide data about a real service, such as used cars,
    planes or whatever. Or is the application itself the item of value?</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Is the app the item for sale ?</h3>
			  <button>NO</button>
			  <button>YES</button>

  <h1>Push Notifications?</h1>
		<p>Push notifications are not available via web (yet). This feature of
    activly pushing data whether it be a plane ticket or annoucement can only
    be done via native.</p>

			<h3>Dependent on push notifications?</h3>
			  <button>NO</button>
			  <button>YES</button>

<script type='text/template' id='q8Content'>
  <h1>Accessibility</h1>
		<p>Does app experience depend on being available on as many screens and
    devices as it can? </p>
		<p>
			<h3>Universal accessibility very important?</h3>
			  <button>NO</button>
			  <button>YES</button>

		<h1>How are you doing?</h1>
		<p> Hopefully you are doing really well. It's important to drink lots of coffee and stuff. Coffee is good for you, but can
			also cause some stomach problems and such.
			MP3s can totally change the industry in a really interesting way. These are lower quality audio because of the bandwidth constraints.
			Dont hurt your business if people arent going to the studios. Take a break from the business and maybe go back to school. Following
			your dreams can be a path to unfullfillment. Giving up isn't giving up, it's changing because you change. Make sure youre not leaving
			any money on the table. It's a big table and it likes to eat up the money, but don't let that take things over, you know? Just keep your 
			stuff together and everything will be ok. The Jedi council beliveves in you. Passion trumps money and skills which is a shame but it's what
			makes us human. To fail is to be human. To human is to fail. To flail is to not swim. </p>
